# Lipophilicity Prediction using Machine Learning and PyTorch Neural Network

In this repository, I will be working with a dataset containing the structural formulas of small molecules along with their corresponding logP values. My goal is to explore the potential of the RDKit library, which is highly effective in handling chemical data, and to utilize the PyTorch framework. While the primary objective of these notebooks is not to create the most advanced models, they serve as a platform for practicing with these powerful tools. I hope my work can serve as inspiration, just as I drew inspiration from the efforts of others.
